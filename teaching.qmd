## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching approach emphasizes active learning, practical application, and the integration of real-world data into the classroom. Drawing on my research in climate-driven mosquito population dynamics, I aim to equip students with the analytical skills and problem-solving strategies needed to address complex questions in mathematics, biology, and data science.

## Teaching Experience
I have taught and assisted in undergraduate mathematics and biology courses, including:

- Differential Equations
- Basic and Applied Statistics
- R Programming for Biological Sciences
- Mathematical Methods

## Instructional Skills
I have experience in:

- Developing instructional materials tailored to diverse learning needs.
- Assessing student performance through assignments, projects, and exams.
- Providing coding support in R and guiding students in research project development.
- Mentoring students in data analysis, modeling, and scientific communication.
