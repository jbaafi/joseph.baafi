I am currently a PhD candidate in Mathematical Biology at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My research focuses on climate-driven models of mosquito population dynamics, using temperature, rainfall, and photoperiod data to inform vector control and public health strategies.

I have experience teaching undergraduate mathematics and programming in R, and enjoy mentoring students in research, data analysis, and scientific communication.
