# Welcome

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematical Biology at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My research focuses on climate-driven models of mosquito population dynamics, using temperature, rainfall, and photoperiod data to inform vector control and public health strategies.

I specialize in deterministic and stochastic modeling, ecological systems analysis, and the integration of climate data into mathematical frameworks. I am proficient in R and LaTeX, and have practical experience using Python, GitHub, and Linux for scientific computing.

I have experience teaching undergraduate mathematics and programming in R, and enjoy mentoring students in research, data analysis, and scientific communication.
