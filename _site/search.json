I use deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches to simulate mosquito life stages, including diapause behavior.\n\nI analyze the implications of seasonal climate change on Culex mosquito abundance and the potential for disease transmission, and apply sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of model outcomes."
