## Overview
My research focuses on developing and analyzing **mathematical models of mosquito population dynamics** in response to environmental conditions such as **temperature**, **rainfall**, and **photoperiod**. These models help uncover how seasonal and climatic factors shape mosquito life cycles and population trends.
I conduct this research under the supervision of <a href="https://ahurford.github.io/website/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr. Amy Hurford.</a>


## Modeling Approaches
I use both deterministic and stochastic modeling frameworks to simulate mosquito life stages — from eggs to adults — incorporating biological processes such as **diapause**. My models integrate climate data to capture realistic seasonal patterns, allowing for robust predictions under varying environmental conditions.

## Applications
The models I develop are applied to assess:

- The **impact of seasonal climate variability and climate change** on mosquito abundance.  
- The **timing and intensity of mosquito activity**, including peak abundance periods.  
- The **potential for disease transmission** under different environmental scenarios.  


## Analytical Tools
To evaluate the robustness of model predictions, I apply **sensitivity analysis** techniques such as **Latin hypercube sampling (LHS)** and 
**partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC)**, alongside **uncertainty analysis** to quantify the effects of input variability. 
I also use **scenario testing** to explore alternative climate and intervention conditions, and employ **visualization tools** (e.g., `ggplot2` in R) 
to communicate findings. These approaches help identify the parameters most influential on population outcomes and guide targeted interventions.
