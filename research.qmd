My research focuses on mathematical models of mosquito population dynamics in response to environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and photoperiod. I use deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches to simulate mosquito life stages, including diapause behavior.

I analyze the implications of seasonal climate change on Culex mosquito abundance and the potential for disease transmission, and apply sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of model outcomes.
